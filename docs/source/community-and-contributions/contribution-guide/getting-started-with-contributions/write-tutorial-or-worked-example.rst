How to write a tutorial or worked example
==========================================

If you are using MapReader in your own work, we would love for you to showcase an example of how you are using MapReader by writing a new tutorial or worked example to our worked example repository.

Before you begin
----------------

If you are currently unfamiliar with using GitHub for collaboration, remember to take a look at our :doc:`GitHub guide </in-depth-resources/github-basics>`.

Before you begin writing your tutorial, you should ensure your tutorial/worked example has a corresponding issue on the `mapreader-examples repository <https://github.com/maps-as-data/mapreader-examples>`_ (or create one if needed).
You should then either assign yourself to the issue or comment on it saying you will be working on making this tutorial.
This ensures that other people know what you are working on.

You will then need to fork the `mapreader-examples repository <https://github.com/maps-as-data-mapreader-examples>`_ in order to make your changes.

Writing your tutorial or worked example
----------------------------------------

You can write your tutorial/worked example in any way you like, we suggest using a `Jupyter notebook <https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_.

Take a look through our current :doc:`worked examples </in-depth-resources/worked-examples/index>` for inspiration.

When you are finished
---------------------

Once you have finished writing your tutorial/worked example, please create a new `pull request <https://github.com/maps-as-data/mapreader-examples/pulls>`_ to let us know you'd like us to look at your work.

If possible, please link your pull request to your corresponding GitHub issue so that we can see that these are related.

Option B
~~~~~~~~

If you really don't feel comfortable using GitHub but would like to work on a tutorial or worked example, please join our `Slack workspace <https://mapreader.slack.com>`_ and message us.
We will do our best to facilitate your contribution to MapReader.
