Who might be interested in using MapReader?
===========================================

MapReader might be useful to you if:

- You have access to a large collection of maps and want to identify visual features or text within them without having to manually annotate each map.
- You want to quickly test different labels to help refine a research question that depends on identifying visual features within maps before/without committing to manual vector data creation.
- Your maps were created before surveying accuracy reached modern standards, and therefore you do not want to create overly precise geolocated data based on the content of those maps.
